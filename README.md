## Economic Data Analysis: Global Macroeconomic Indicators

This project analyzes key macroeconomic indicators to understand economic trends and relationships. Using Python, the study focuses on GDP, inflation, interest rates, unemployment, and cost-of-living index to generate insights useful for business and policy decision-making.

# Datasets Used
- **GDP.csv** – Gross Domestic Product over time  
- **inflation.csv** – Inflation rate data  
- **interest_rates.csv** – Interest rate trends  
- **unemployment.csv** – Unemployment rate data  
- **Cost_of_Living_Index_2022.csv** – Cross-country cost-of-living index (2022)

# Tools & Technologies
- Python  
- Pandas, NumPy  
- Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- Statsmodels, pmdarima  
- Jupyter Notebook

# Methodology
1. Data cleaning and preprocessing  
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
3. Time-series visualization  
4. Correlation and descriptive statistics  
5. GDP forecasting using ARIMA  

---

# Key Insights
- GDP shows long-term growth with short-term fluctuations  
- Inflation volatility influences interest rate adjustments  
- Unemployment trends inversely with GDP  
- High cost-of-living countries reflect higher price levels and wages  

---

# Forecasting
- ARIMA model applied to GDP data  
- Forecast provides short-term economic trend direction  
- Suitable for scenario analysis and planning
